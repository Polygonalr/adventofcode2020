# Advent of Code 2020

I had taken back my opinion about Rust from my Advent of Code 2019 repository. After digging deeper into Rust (kinda forced to do so due to reasons), I had come to appreciate the language's philosophy. Days 1-4 were code done quite a bit back while I was still in national service to practise more of Rust's `enum` and `Result<T, E>`. I'll do future exercises when I feel like it.
